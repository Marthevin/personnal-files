But fist of all, what is the thing we call self-awareness anyway? It is the ability to see us clearly and understand who we r, how others see us and how we fit into the world. And there is a ton of research showing that people who r self-aware are more fulfilled. They have stronger relationships, they r more creative and more confident and better conmunicators. 

In one research, only 50 of thousands of thousands of people researched met the criteria of being self-aware. We call them self-awareness unicorns. They r professionals, entrepreneurs, artists, students, stay-at-home parents. And I did not find any pattern based on industry, gender, age or any other demographic charateristics. The unicorns helped the researchers find a most intesting truth, that mothods that we used to introspect ourselves is totally wrong.  

A 20-year-old study that looked at how widowers adjusted to life without their partners. The truth that the research found is that those who try to understand the meaning of their loss were happier, less depressed one month later, but one year later, were more depressed. They were more fixated on what happened to them instead of moving forward. Self-analysis can trap us in a mental hell of our own making.

But most of u here may be thinking that, sure, introspection may be depressing, but it worth it because the insight it produces. Yes, u r right. I am not tell u that the persuit of self-awareness is a waste of time. Not at all.I am here to tell u the way u pursue it doesn't work. Here is the surprising reality: thinking urself is not related to knowing ourselves. 

So to understand this, let us look at the most common introspective question:Why. we might be searching for the cause of a bad mood. Why am I so upset afer that fight with my friend? Or we might be questioning our beliefs. Why don't I believe death penalty? Or we might try to understand a negative outcome: why did I choke in that meeting? Unfortunately, when we asked why, it does not lead us toward the truth of ourselves. It leads us away from it. There are so many reasons in this case, today I'll give u two:

Here is the first reason that we should not ask why: researchers have found that no matter how hard we try, we cannot [excavate] our unconcious thoughts, feelings and motives.And because so much is hidden under our conscious awareness, we end up inventing answers that feel true but are often very wrong. 

The second reason that we should not ask why is that it leads us away from our true nature. We like to think of our brains as a super computer, rationally analyze information and get accurate conclusion. Unfortunately, that's not what happens.[Asking why creates alternative facts]. And over time, this leads us away from who we really are. It clouds our self-perception.

So since wo should not ask why, what should we do? So let me tell u the answer: Ask what. So let me give u a few of examples. 

Hellen, a brand manager, got a poor review of her season performance from her manager. Instead of asking, why r we like oil and water? She asked, what should I do to show her I am the best for this job? It changed everything. People now point to Hellen and her boss as proof that polar opposites can work together. 

Sarah, an education leader, was diagnosed with breast cancer in her late 40s. When asked "why me", it felt like a death sentence. So when she asked 'what is most important to me', things has changed because it helps her to define what her life should look like the time left to her. Now she is cancer free and focuses more on the relationship that means the most to her.

This is not an easy world, isn't it? Not at all. There are so much evidence that self-awareness gives us a better shot at finding happiness and success in this crazy world. To start, we need only change a simple word, from why to what. Why questions trapped us in the rearmirror, what questions move us toward a better world. As human beings, we r blessed with the abilty to understand who we r, what we want to contribute, and the kind of life we want to lead. Remember that our self-awareness unicorns have nothing in common, except a blief to self-awareness and a daily commitment to developing it. That means that all of us can be unicorns. 

The search for self-awareness never ever stops. Life goes on. It is up to us to choose to learn and grow through our mistakes, our tragedies and our successes. One of the best quates that I have ever heard is from Rumi. He said, "Yesterday I am clever, so I want to change the world. Today I am wise, So I decide to change myself". thank you very much.
